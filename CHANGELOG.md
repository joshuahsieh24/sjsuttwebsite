## 📖 About Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning uses a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format:

- **MAJOR** version (e.g. 1.x.x) — increment when you make **incompatible or breaking changes**
- **MINOR** version (e.g. x.1.x) — increment when you **add functionality** in a backward-compatible way
- **PATCH** version (e.g. x.x.1) — increment when you **fix bugs** or make backward-compatible maintenance changes

Examples:
- `1.2.3` → `2.0.0` for a breaking change
- `1.2.3` → `1.3.0` for new features that don't break existing usage
- `1.2.3` → `1.2.4` for a simple bug fix
